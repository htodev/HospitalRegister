          ENROLL SYSTEM

The purpose of this design is to create Django project.
That system will help hospitals monitor admitted patients and
their appointed doctors. It will also contain basic information
about the condition of the patients and other data.
    Ð¢he requirements are as follows:

        * Each doctor must have  an user.
        * Each doctor  must list himself in the enrollment system,
        which list will be accessible to everyone.
        * Each doctor must keep a record of the patients admitted by him.
            * This record is common and  accessible only for the doctors.
            * The doctor can delete or update the registry, but only for the patients,
        related to him.
            * Only doctors can filter registry by doctor name.
        * There must be a list with names of all hospitalized patients visible to
        everyone.
        * Only admin and doctors (owners of the profile) can edit that profile.
